I made significant progress last-minute in severe issues like fast memory leaks, JSON strings not
making it to fragment displays, etc. but there is still plenty of room for improvement.

Known issues:

    Layout cramping in landscape mode
        -Mostly cosmetic but can hinder usability

    BackStack stacks too many fragments
        -Results in slow memory leak
