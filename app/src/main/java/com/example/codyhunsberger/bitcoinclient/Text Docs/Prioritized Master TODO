A. MISSING CORE PROMPT REQUIREMENTS
> 1. Block Fragment (requires item B2)

B. BROKEN CORE PROMPT REQUIREMENTS
> 2. JSON Data display in Wallet Fragment
> 3. Memory leak/loading thing
> 4. Chart Fragment leaks like a faucet, timer starts going nuts after a few minutes
> 5. Reuse fragments
> Make sure there are no string literals in your code.

C. MOST APP IMPROVEMENT PER TIME COST
> 1. Layout tweaking
    > 1a. Button in Ticker/Auto Refresh (requires item B1)
> 3. Long press Wallet ListView item to remove.
> Remove backstack usage, add home button (may fix leak)

D. LESS IMPORTANT
> 1. Ticker takes a second load to display data
> 2. Have daily change rates in BTC prices in ticker


E. LEAST IMPORTANT (Purely Costmetic)
> 1. Browse IDE warnings and modify accordingly
> 2. Resize chart view to fit image (512x288)
    > Use ImageView instead of WebView?
